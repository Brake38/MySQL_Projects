# Cruise Line Database â€“ MySQL Coursework

This repository contains MySQL assignments and database design work completed as part of the *Database Principles* course (ITEC 3245) at Middle Georgia State University.

** Overview
The coursework involved:
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve and filter data from relational tables.
- Designing and interpreting an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- Executing and testing queries using the MySQL command line.

The database models a cruise line scenario, including ships, passengers, sailors, and voyage data.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `AND/OR`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- `JOIN` operations between multiple tables
- Filtering data by date ranges and specific values
- Understanding and visualizing entity relationships (ERD)
- Data modeling using crow's foot notation

-----

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The module 12 assignment document represents the structure of the cruise ship database used throughout the semester.

The ERD diagram includes tables for:
- Cruises
- Ship
- Sailors
- Passengers
- Visit Logs
- Inheritance structure for the various ship types

Relationships are represented using crow's feet notation.
